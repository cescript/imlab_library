# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
# set the version
gem 'jekyll', '3.7.4'

# add seo tag
gem "jekyll-seo-tag", "2.1.0"
